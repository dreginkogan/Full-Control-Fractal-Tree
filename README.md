# Full-Control-Fractal-Tree

Generates fractal trees using the [Full Control Python Library](https://github.com/FullControlXYZ/fullcontrol)

This wont really print anything and will probably break your printer, im more of just using the library to visualize stuff, which is very stupid, but whatever.
